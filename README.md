Python scripts for generating the Figures included in the article "The sound of a harp string" available at https://euphonics.org/extra-material-on-string-selection/.  
This article explores how the mechanical properties of the different materials used for non-metallic harp strings affect the way they sound, and offers at least a partial explanation of why gut strings sound so much better than nylon, and why fluorocarbon strings provide a much better alternative to nylon, but still donâ€™t sound the same as natural gut strings.

To explore the effects of changing string lengths or diameters, edit the "string gauge charts.csv" file. All values in millimetres. Note that string lengths are measured from the soundboard up to the lower arm of the upper fourchette, with the pedals set in the middle position.

For those unfamiliar with Python, the spreadsheet "string sound tool E2.xlsx" provides an alternative.
