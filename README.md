Python scripts for generating the Figures included in the article "The sound of a harp string" available at https://euphonics.org/extra-material-on-string-selection/.  
This article explores how the mechanical properties of the different materials used for non-metallic harp strings affect the way they sound, and offers at least a partial explanation of why gut strings sound so much better than nylon, and why fluorocarbon strings provide a much better alternative to nylon, but still donâ€™t sound the same as natural gut strings.
